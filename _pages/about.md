I'm a 3rd year PhD student at The University of Texas at Austin, working with [Dr.Peter Stone](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone) at the Learning Agents Research Group [LARG](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/students.shtml).
My primary research focus is on Reinforcement Learning, applied to Robotics. I'm interested in Reinforcement Learning, Computer Vision and Imitation Learning applied to Robotics. 

In my past lives, I've studied classical control theory for robotics. I did my master's degree at Texas A&M's Aerospace Engineering department where I was fortunate to be advised by [Robert Skelton](https://bobskelton.github.io/).
