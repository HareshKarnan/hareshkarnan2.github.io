excerpt: 'In this work, we show that the Grounded Action Transformation algorithm for Sim-to-Real transfer can be formulated as an Imitation from Observation problem. We propose a new algorithm Generative Adversarial Reinforced Action Transformation (GARAT) for transfer learning to address Dynamics Mismatch between the source and target domains.'
