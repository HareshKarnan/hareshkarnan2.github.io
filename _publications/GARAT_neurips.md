title: "An Imitation from Observation Approach to Transfer Learning for Dynamics Mismatch"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/GARAT_neurips
excerpt: 'In this work, we show that the Grounded Action Transformation algorithm for Sim-to-Real transfer can be formulated as an Imitation from Observation problem. We propose a new algorithm called Generative Adversarial Reinforced Action Transformation (GARAT) for transfer learning to address Dynamics Mismatch between the source and target domains.'
